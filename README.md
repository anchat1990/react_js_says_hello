Simple react js hello world app using webpack and babel

Follow steps in [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel) tutorial. 

Modify the "start" script in package.json from 
```webpack-dev-server``` 
to 
```webpack-dev-server --progress --watch --watch-poll --inline```
